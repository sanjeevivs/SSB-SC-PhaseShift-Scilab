# SSB-SC Modulation Using Phase Shift Method in Xcos (Scilab)

## 📜 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates **Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) Modulation** using the **Phasing Method** in **Scilab Xcos**. The aim is to simulate, visualize, and analyze how phase-shifted message signals combined with quadrature carriers produce an SSB signal, reducing both bandwidth and power consumption.


## ⚙️ Software Used:
- Scilab 6.x
- Xcos (Graphical Simulation Environment)


## 📝 Project Description:
- **SSB-SC** transmits only one sideband (either Upper or Lower), unlike traditional AM or DSB-SC.
- Utilizes the **Phasing Method:**
    - Message signal is multiplied with a cosine carrier.
    - Phase-shifted message signal is multiplied with a sine carrier.
    - The outputs are summed to cancel one sideband.

### Key Advantages:
- Bandwidth-efficient
- Power-saving
- Minimal interference due to carrier suppression


## 📊 Simulation Outputs:
- Message Signal
- Carrier Signal
- SSB-SC Output Signal

## ✅ Result:
The simulation was successfully completed. The resulting CSCOPE output showed a single sideband as expected, confirming efficient SSB modulation.
